# Smart-Wallet
Smart wallet is revolutionary solution to the traditional wallet interaction. This wallet solution used account abstraction, bundlers and our special hook feature, to make the transaction secure and efficient.

## Account Abstraction
It is a solution designed to make the user experience more seamless by breaking down traditional boundaries that separate contract accounts from externally owned accounts.

2.1 Traditional Model: In most blockchain platforms, when a user deploys a smart contract or invokes a function within a contract, they need to pay for the computation and storage resources consumed by that contract. This can be problematic because it can create friction for users and limit the functionality of smart contracts.

2.2 Account Abstraction: With account abstraction, the smart contract itself can pay for its execution. This means that the contract's balance is used to cover the costs of running the contract code. In this model, the user or the entity invoking the contract doesn't need to pay gas fees directly, and the contract can be more self-sufficient.


2.3 Key Features of SmartWallet's Account Abstraction
a) Off-chain Signing: By allowing users to sign transactions off-chain, SmartWallet ensures: 
*  Reduction in on-chain congestion as transactions don't need to be broadcasted immediately.
*  Enhanced privacy as off-chain data isn't immediately visible on the blockchain.
*  Immediate user feedback without waiting for blockchain confirmations.
   
b) Paymaster: A designated entity within the SmartWallet ecosystem, the Paymaster manages:
Covering transaction gas fees, simplifying the user experience by eliminating the need for manual gas fee handling. Refunding gas fees, if necessary, according to the platform's protocols.

c) Staking for Fees: A user-friendly approach to transaction costs:
Users deposit a certain amount in their SmartWallet, designated for fees. As transactions occur, their associated fees are automatically deducted from this staked amount. Users can track, top-up, or withdraw from this staked amount, providing them complete control over their funds.

## Transaction Bundler
By bundling multiple transactions, SmartWallet facilitates reduced gas fees and faster processing times. This is especially beneficial for users executing numerous transactions in a short period, such as during peak trading times or dApp interactions.

## Special Hooks
Special Hooks enable users to set both timeless and time-bound limit orders with just off-chain signing.

4.1 Working
A user sets a desired limit for a transaction (buy/sell/swaps). The request remains dormant until the specified conditions are met. Once the criteria are achieved, the Solver API triggers and executes the transaction, charging a nominal commission for the service.

4.2 Use Cases
Price-based Transactions: A user wants to buy Comdex with all his XUSD when the Comdex price drops to a certain level within a specified timeframe. With SmartWallet's Limit Hooks, the user can set this condition and continue his daily tasks without locking his tokens or continuously monitoring the market.
Depreciation Protection: Users can shield themselves from token depreciation, e.g., if a stablecoin like XUSD falls below $0.98, the system can be set to automatically swap all XUSD to Comdex, thus preserving the user's value.

## Solutioning
This solution for the wallet can be apply on any chain from cosmosSdk environment, with wallet connection and few changes accoding to the chain. Thats make SmartWallet extremely important.
